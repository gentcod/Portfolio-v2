/**I am a creative and innovative Developer and Designer who likes to properly undestand how things work.
I like to describe myself as a Jack of a lot, definitely not all ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. 
I am skilled in a lot of aspects and this is as a result of my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new situations and challenges. 
This comes in handy not only in my career or professional field, I use it in all aspect of life. 
I also like sharing knowledge, as I believe true mastery of a skill cannot be achieved without sharing what you know. Kindly take your time to go through my portfolio. 
I am open to feedback, so feel free to reach out to me and provide one. Lastly, I love anime and yes, I have seen One PieceðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
